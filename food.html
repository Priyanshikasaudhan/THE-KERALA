            Foreign influence on the cuisine of Kerala is marked,
             with each religion  from Muslims to Syrian Christians developing
              their own cuisine and style of preparation. The Moplah cuisine of 
              the Malabar region has a distinct flavour, borrowed from the traders 
              who regularly visited the region. Kerala cuisine has an abundance of coconut, 
              rice, tapioca and spices like black pepper, cloves, cinnamon and ginger. 
              The Portuguese introduced cassava, now widely eaten in Kerala. The region is
               also famous for its Sadhya, served at the Hindu festival Onam and consisting of 
               boiled rice and a host of vegetarian dishes on a banana leaf. Kerala cuisine also 
               features a lot of sea food 
            like fish, prawns, mussels and crabs because of its long coastline.

    Puttu is a cylindrical steamed rice cake cooked in a mould with grated coconut.

    <br> spices and coconut milk, that can also be served with ripe bananas and grated coconut.

    Appam is a Keralan staple made from fermented rice flour and coconut milk. It’s similar to a thin pancake with crispy edges. These crepe-like bowls are made from fermented rice flour, coconut milk, coconut water and a little sugar. Ishtu or stew is a derivative of the European stew and consists of coconut milk, cinnamon, cloves and shallots, eaten with appams. The stew may also feature mango pieces, vegetables, chicken or lamb. The addition of aromatic whole spices, ginger and fresh coconut milk enhance the natural flavor of the vegetables. The crucial ingredient is fresh coconut milk, which lends a sweet flavor.

        Layered flat bread that originated in the Malabar region called Parotta is made by kneading maida (plain flour), egg (in some recipes), oil or ghee and water. The dough is beaten and later shaped into a spiral with thin layers. The ball is rolled flat and roasted into a Parotta with ghee. This is then eaten with beef curry – pieces of beef simmered in a curry made with tomatoes, onions, garlic and spices like bay leaves, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, black peppercorns and star anise.

        This is one of Kerala’s traditional delicacies. Karimeen or pearl spot fish is a speckled fish commonly found in the backwaters of this state. This is traditionally a Syrian Christian delicacy but has become part of Kerala’s rich cuisine. Pearl spot fish is marinated in a mixture of lemon juice, red chillies, and other ingredients, wrapped and baked in plantain leaves, giving it a unique flavour.

        This is a signature dish of the state – a prawn curry from the Malabar region made with a blend of fenugreek, black mustard and fennel seeds, coconut milk and green chilli. It also includes a special ingredient called kudampuli (also known as brindleberry) to give it a sour taste, plus it uses marinated prawns, drumsticks and raw mango to give it a spicy, tangy flavour.
