  The beaches in Kerala radiate a unique appeal as the shoreline of Kerala
   is encased by the gorgeous Western Ghats. These beaches are all the more 
   alluring because of a lack of footfall of tourists in some of them. Many 
   of them are comparatively virgin and pristine. If living by the sea or
    spending a day amidst nature is in your scheme of things, you should
     not give a miss to Kerala beaches and sunset points. You can not only 
     escape the daily grind of city life but also beat the crowd
   and enjoy a great vacation with your friends or family in solitude.
